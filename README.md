# React Component Library

## Getting started
This was created with the Create React App so reference those docs whenever you can.

## Exported redux reducer
The goal was to have a slice of state that is for this components alone, so you can manage on that level. Import the reducer into your `combineReducers()` method inside of your store.

## Running the App & output
Right now this is for local development, you will link this with your other project. You can add your own publish step to NPM.

```bash
npm link
```

```bash
yarn build
```

```bash
yarn babel:watch
```
